This code uses the same concepts from my Pixel Test Kit but the controls are implemented using an app made from MIT App Inventor. It can control the following led drivers:

a. WS2811

b. TX1818

c. UCS2804B

d. WS2814

Creating an app is a very new skill that I am learning while enjoying the easier approach of coding blocks rather than using Java.
